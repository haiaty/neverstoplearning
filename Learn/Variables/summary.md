In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable.

Rules for PHP variables:

* A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
* A variable name cannot start with a number
* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
* Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)  

As a regular expression, it would be expressed thus: '[a-zA-Z_\x7f-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x7f-\xff]*'
