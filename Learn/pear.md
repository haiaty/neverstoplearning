# PEAR

PEAR is PHP Extension and Application Repository, it has libraries and code written IN php. Those you can simply download, install and include in your code.

It's a repository of libraries, but it's also a distribution channel/packaging system. Originally, the packaging system just distributed the single PEAR repository, but today, the distribution channel can be used by any third party library. 

Each PEAR code package comprises an independent project under the PEAR umbrella. It has its own development team, versioning-control and documentation.
