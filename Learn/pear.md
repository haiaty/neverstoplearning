# PEAR

PEAR is PHP Extension and Application Repository, it has libraries and code written IN php. Those you can simply download, install and include in your code.

It's a repository of libraries, but it's also a distribution channel/packaging system. Originally, the packaging system just distributed the single PEAR repository, but today, the distribution channel can be used by any third party library.
