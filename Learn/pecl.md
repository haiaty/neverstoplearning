# PECL

PECL is a repository for PHP Extensions, providing a directory of all known extensions and hosting facilities for downloading and development of PHP extensions.

It has extensions written in C, that can be loaded into PHP to provide additional functionality. You need to have administrator rights, a C compiler and associated toolchain to install those extensions.

PECL extensions are documented alongside standard extensions within the PHP Manual, so there is no special manual for PECL extensions.

Several extensions began their development cycle in PECL and ended up in core (the distributed PHP source)
